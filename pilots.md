The first objective of the second phase of Opening Reproducible Research (o2r) is _"Use ERCs for actual scientific publications"_.
In several work packages the o2r team will implement pilots.
In _collaboration pilots_, we work with publishers on Virtual Special Issues (VSIs).
In these VSIs, submitted articles will have [ERCs](/results) as supplemental material - an evolutionary use of ERCs.
In a _self-hosted pilot_, we want to realise a more revolutionary use of ERCs.
By extending Open Journal Systems (OJS) we make the ERC the item under review in a demonstration journal.
The pilots are supported by operating infrastructure and supporting authors, reviewers, and readers to engage with ERCs.

The diversity of the VSIs, potentially covering journals from a variety of geoscience disciplines, allows to reach the broad authorship and readership of the involved journals.
It evaluates the creation and inspection process for ERCs outside of a prototypical lab setting, so the technical infrastructure for ERCs is completely overhauled to support a growing number of users.

The self-hosted pilot replaces the traditional paper with ERCs.
It demonstrates ERCs’ potential to stakeholders and provides a platform for evaluation of ERCs in education.
The three pilots cover current publication practices from large scale publishers to independent journals.
All pilots require the integration of o2r services and tools in existing, established IT systems and organisational workflows.
The pilots are accompanied by monitoring and user studies.
_The pilots will provide crucial data to learn about the costs and benefits of ERC-based research publications._

_Are you a journal editor and at the EGU General Assembly 2019?_
Join the information session UMI17 [Inter-journal special issue for reproducible research using R](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/34565) in room 3.29 on Thursday, 11 April, 15:45-16:30 hrs.

### We are open for collaboration around OJS journals
<a name="ojs">

The first plans for self-hosted pilot based on OJS are described in this blog post: [https://o2r.info/2019/10/15/Opening-Reproducible-Research-with-OJS/](https://o2r.info/2019/10/15/Opening-Reproducible-Research-with-OJS/)

The self-hosted pilot will be used to investigate the impact of ERCs on understanding by preparing articles used in education as an ERC as a replacement or complement to reading material in a geoinformatics seminar.

_We are looking for feedback on these plans and are open for collaboration with OJS developers and OJS journal maintainers who are interested in enhanced publications powered by OJS._
