o2r Team member [Daniel](htts://nordholmen.net) was invited by the university's press office to participate in a [series of interviews and articles on digitisation or "digitalisation" at the WWU Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/index.php?mod=archive&rubrik=pr-digitalisierung&lang=en):

The video is now [available online in German](https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=9388) (embedded below) and [with English subtitles](https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=9395).
You can also watch it [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wwumuenster/videos/10156084978130350/) or in the [WWU video portal](https://www.uni-muenster.de/videoportal/digitalisierung.html#nuest).

Daniel wrote a brief summary for our blog and shares his experience:

**Interview summary**

> First we talked about how digitisation is a familiar topic for computer scientists professionally (digital data, algorithms), but also something we encounter as citizens.<!--more-->
> Next I explained the importance of reproducibility in science and when asked if that was not the case in the past, I outlined the new challenges of a completely digital research workflow.
> I summarise the idea of the o2r project and use the term _"digital laboratory"_ as a metaphor for our Executable Research Compendium, which collects all research artefacts and opens them up in a transparent way and allows collaboration.
> We then briefly touch on the fact that the concepts and ideas are relevant for all sciences, but how o2r (and geoinformatics) focuses on geoscience applications.
> Looking ahead I mention our plans to bring our idea of a reproducible article into the publishing workflow of regular scientists.
> Is digitisation a blessing or a curse? It's both, because it creates new challenges and exciting applications in geoinformatics, but the amount of information in large datasets is not always clear and requires critical dealing.

**What was it like?**

> Shooting the interview was fun and a great experience.
> Having two cameras pointed at you and 4 people standing critically observing in the background could have been intimidating, but it wasn't - big thanks to the team!
> 
> The film shooting took only about 40 minutes (some technical preparations, two full takes, a little break and small talk) and was prepared with a one-hour conversation some weeks ahead.
> I wrote down answers to some questions I expected - but the actual questions were not shared, for the better I think because the spontaneity makes it a conversation and less of a lecture.
> The video published online is from the second, shorter take.
> I wish they would have used the first one, because it was longer (around 10 minutes, so double the target time) and I could make more good points and feel like I got the message across better.
> Researchers can go on for hours about topics they care about, and I hope my enthusiasm about Open Science and Reproducible Research does come across.
> Though I am partly unhappy with the content, I hope the brevity spikes interest by fellow researchers and students at University of Münster.
> Next time you feel like cutting down your paper from 6000 to 5000 words is hard, try bringing it down to 2 minutes of talking to a non-expert :-).
> A worthwhile excercise by the way.
>
> Although in this case, a non-expert could very well be an experienced scientists!
> The lack of a common terminology for reproducible/replicable etc. became very apparent during the preparations.
> For the next video I'll make every spectator read ["Terminologies for Reproducible Research"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03311) first ...
>
> ["Digitalisierung"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitalisierung) is a very hot topic in Germany, both in [politics](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/germanys-needs-to-modernize-and-embrace-digitization-merkel-says.html) and [economy](https://www.politico.eu/article/5-questions-for-germanys-digital-future/). It regularly makes it into national news and more and more also into small talk.
> There is so much connected with digitisation I did not touch on, like artificial intelligence (AI). How can we ensure research transparency and reproducibility when we don't even know how something works?
> _The one thing I regret_ not saying in the interview is the fact that having studied computer science, I rarely grasp the difficulties non-programmers must have with digitisation.
> While I do sometimes have to "explain computers" to friends and family, I don't do it often enough, and must show more patience when I get the chance.
> AI, web services, cloud computing - it is complex stuff!
> Let's help non-techies close to us more in understanding them (reading recommendation: ["Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet" by Andrew Blum](https://www.amazon.com/Tubes-Journey-Internet-Andrew-Blum/dp/0061994952)) !
>
> Formulating my view on digitisation in research and its impact on research reproducibility in "plain language" was a worthwhile challenge and I can only recommend every researcher to participate in public relations workshops et cetera to try it out.
> You got to take every chance you can get to reach out to non-scientists (research resolution: [Make sure all papers have non-specialist summaries](https://twitter.com/Protohedgehog/status/949315968903376896?s=09)).
> I applaud all bloggers and podcasters out there who do!
