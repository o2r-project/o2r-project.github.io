I"’<p>â€œGeoscientist with experience in or willingness to learn R programming for reproducible research wanted!â€ I had just completed a beginner course in R programming for my masterâ€™s thesis and saw my chance to further develop this knowledge and enter the geoinformatic field, also get a little away from the pure ecology of my master studies in landscape ecology. I had never before heard of the words â€œreproducible researchâ€, neither heard of any reason why this topic is of importance. I took the job and worked my way in. After a couple of months I had to realize that to publish my masterâ€™s thesis in an international journal, all code and data had to be made freely available to enable other researchers to fully understand and reuse my analysis. And there I was, as a landscape ecologist who believed I had nothing to do with reproducible research. Apparently it is not that simple after all.</p>
