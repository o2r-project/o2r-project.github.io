I"Z<p><em>A new preprint is out!</em> 📢</p>

<p>With the first commit on <a href="https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/d_nues01/architecture-paper">the manuscript repository</a> made on August 1st 2018, almost three years ago, this one is long overdue.
In the article, <!--more-->o2r team member <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0024-5046">Daniel</a> summarises over 5 years of designing and implementing the the o2r software infrastructure for <em>Executable Research Compendia</em> (ERCs).
The article <em>“A Web service for executable research compendia enables reproducible publications and transparent reviews in geospatial science”</em> is now published on Zenodo:</p>

  <p>Nüst, Daniel. (2021, July 8). A Web service for executable research compendia enables reproducible publications and transparent reviews in geospatial sciences (Version 1). Zenodo. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4818120">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4818120</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The preprint covers the ERC specification, o2r API specification, the o2r system architecture, and the o2r reference implementation - the <em>ERC Reproducibility Service</em>.
It contains an extensive discussion and provides lessons learned from implementing ambitious ideas for increasing reproducibility.
This article’s most important section though is Acknowledgements: all o2r team members, past and present, contributed to making the vision of ERCs for scholarly communication a reality. <em>Thanks everyone!</em></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Executable Research Compendium (ERC) is a concept for packaging data, code, text, and user interface configurations in a single package to increase transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of computational research. This article introduces the ERC reproducibility service (ERS) for a publication workflow enhanced by ERCs.
The ERS connects with existing scientific infrastructures and was deployed and tested with a focus on data and visualisation methods for open geospatial sciences. We describe the architecture of a reference implementation for the reproducibility service, including the created Web API. We critically discuss both the project set-up and features of ERC and ERS, and examine them in the light of various classifications for reproducible research. The ERC and ERS are found to be a powerful tool to improve reproducibility and thereby enable better investigating and understanding of computational workflows during peer review. We derive lessons learned and challenges for future scholarly publishing of computer-based geospatial research.</p>
